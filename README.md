This research is from http://www.noprimeleftbehind.net/crus/Sierp-conjectures.htm and http://www.noprimeleftbehind.net/crus/Riesel-conjectures.htm, extended to the k such that gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) is not 1.

Sierpinski problem base b:

Finding and proving the smallest k such that gcd(k+1,b-1)=1 and k*b^n+1 is not prime for all integers n>=1.

Riesel problem base b:

Finding and proving the smallest k such that gcd(k-1,b-1)=1 and k*b^n-1 is not prime for all integers n>=1.

Extended Sierpinski problem base b:

Finding and proving the smallest k such that (k*b^n+1)/gcd(k+1,b-1) is not prime for all integers n>=1.

Extended Riesel problem base b:

Finding and proving the smallest k such that (k*b^n-1)/gcd(k-1,b-1) is not prime for all integers n>=1.

Notes:

All n must be >= 1.

k-values that make a full covering set with all or partial algebraic factors are excluded from the conjectures.

k-values that are a multiple of base (b) and where (k+-1)/gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) is not prime are included in the conjectures but excluded from testing.
Such k-values will have the same prime as k / b.

See "table of Riesel problems.txt" and "table of Sierpinski problems.txt" for the remain k's for each base and the top 10 first primes.
